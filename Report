University Database Management System in Oracle: Project Report
Introduction
This report documents the development of a comprehensive University Database Management System (UDBMS) using Oracle. The project covers the design and implementation of the database schema, including tables, indexes, views, procedures, triggers, and sample data insertion. This system aims to manage various aspects of university operations such as student enrollment, course management, professor assignments, and grade tracking.
